/**
 * WebSocketProvider provides convenience methods for interacting with the
 * WebSocketPublisher to publish messages to the various client websockets by
 * way of an Akka mediator. Server code should interact with this class to send
 * messages to clients rather than trying to access actors or the mediator
 * directly.
 *
 * Note that the mediator is responsible for determining which client
 * websockets receive which messages based on each client's communicated
 * subscription preferences, so server code need not worry about trying to
 * address messages to particular clients when using the sendMessage method.
 *
 * The various supported types of messages and data formats, along with helper
 * methods to easily and correctly construct them, can be found in
 * WebSocketMessage
